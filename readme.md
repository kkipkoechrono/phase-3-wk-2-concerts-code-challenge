## Phase 3 Code Challenge: Concerts
For this assignment, we'll be working with a Concert domain.

- We have three models: Band, Concert, and Venue.

- For our purposes, a Band has many Concerts, a Venue has many Concerts, and a Concert belongs to a Band and to a Venue.

- Band - Venue is a many to many relationship.

Note: You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard before you start coding. Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.

# Topics
SQLAlchemy Migrations
SQLAlchemy Relationships
Class and Instance Methods
SQLAlchemy Querying
# Instructions
To get started, run pipenv install while inside of this directory.

Build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. The methods are listed in a suggested order, but you can feel free to tackle the ones you think are easiest. Be careful: some of the later methods rely on earlier ones.

Remember! This code challenge does not have tests. You cannot run pytest. You'll need to create your own sample instances so that you can try out your code on your own. Make sure your relationships and methods work in the console before submitting.

We've provided you with a tool that you can use to test your code. To use it, run python debug.py from the command line. This will start a ipdb session with your classes defined. You can test out the methods that you write here. You are also encouraged to use the seeds.py file to create sample data to test your models and relationships.

- Writing error-free code is more important than completing all of the deliverables listed - prioritize writing methods that work over writing more methods that don't work. You should test your code in the console as you write.

- Similarly, messy code that works is better than clean code that doesn't. First, prioritize getting things working. Then, if there is time at the end, refactor your code to adhere to best practices.

- Before you submit! Save and run your code to verify that it works as you expect. If you have any methods that are not working yet, feel free to leave comments describing your progress.

- What You Already Have
The starter code has migrations and models for the initial Band and Venue models, and seed data for some Bands and Venues. The schema currently looks like this:

## bands Table
Column	Type
name	String
hometown	String
## venues Table
Column	Type
title	String
city	String
- You will need to create the migration for the concerts table using the attributes specified in the deliverables below.

## Deliverables
Write the following methods in the classes in the files provided. Feel free to build out any helper methods if needed.

#Remember: SQLAlchemy give your classes access to a lot of methods already! Keep in mind what methods SQLAlchemy gives you access to on each of your classes when you're approaching the deliverables below.

## Migrations
Before working on the rest of the deliverables, you will need to create a migration for the concerts table.

- A Concert belongs to a Band, and a Concert also belongs to a Venue. In your migration, create any columns your concerts table will need to establish these relationships.
The concerts table should also have:
A date column that stores an string.
After creating the concerts table using a migration, use the seeds.py file to create instances of your Concert class so you can test your code.

** - Once you've set up your concerts table, work on building out the following deliverables.

## Object Relationship Methods
- Use SQLAlchemy query methods where appropriate.

## Concert
- Concert band()
should return the Band instance for this Concert
- Concert venue()
should return the Venue instance for this Concert
Venue
- Venue concerts()
returns a collection of all the concerts for the Venue
- Venue bands()
returns a collection of all the bands who performed at the Venue
Band
Band concerts()
should return a collection of all the concerts that the Band has played
- Band venues()
should return a collection of all the venues that the Band has performed at
Use python test.py and check that these methods work before proceeding. For example, you should be able to call session.query(Band).first().venues and see a list of the venues for the first band in the database based on your seed data; and session.query(Band).first() should return the band for the first concert in the database.

## Aggregate and Relationship Methods
- Concert
Concert hometown_show()
returns true if the concert is in the band's hometown, false if it is not
Concert introduction()
returns a string with the band's introduction for this concert
an introduction is in the form:
"Hello {insert venue city}!!!!! We are {insert band name} and we're from
{insert band hometown}"
Band
- Band play_in_venue(venue, date)
takes a venue (Venue instance) and date (as a string) as arguments
creates a new concert for the band in that venue on that date
Band all_introductions()
returns an array of strings representing all the introductions for this band
each introduction is in the form:
"Hello {insert venue city}!!!!! We are {insert band name} and we're from
{insert band hometown}"
- Band most_performances() class method
returns the Band instance for the band that has played the most concerts
Note: solving this using only SQLAlchemy methods is possible, but difficult. Feel free to use regular Python enumerable methods here.
Venue
- Venue concert_on(date)
takes a date (string) as argument
finds and returns the first concert on that date at that venue
- Venue most_frequent_band()
returns the band with the most concerts at the venue
Note: solving this using only SQLAlchemy methods is possible, but difficult. Feel free to use regular Python enumerable methods here.
Solved
## Run Instructions
To get started, run pipenv install && pipenv shell while inside of root directory.
1. Run alembic upgrade head
2. Run python test.py

Run session.query(Band).first() (Should return Band: Imagine Dragons)
